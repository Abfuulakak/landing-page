									<h2>Who I am</h2>
									<p>I student on a gap year with a strong academic background and a passion for technology, cybersecurity, and the financial sector. I excel in problem-solving and have demonstrated outstanding performance in Mathematics, Further Mathematics, and Economics. My education is complemented by hands-on work experiences at JP Morgan and Circana, where I developed my coding and data analysis skills. I am proficient in Python and have completed notable projects in computer vision and data science. My leadership, teamwork, and communication skills are further evidenced by my roles as a football captain and a volunteer for various charities. I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, with proficiency in multiple languages and a track record of academic and extracurricular achievements.</p>

									<h3>Testing A Computer's Vision</h3>
									<p>The project aimed to develop a Python based computer vision solution for image classification. The task was to create a model that could accurately
										classify images into predefined categories. Obtained a set of labelled images for training and testing (cat and dog) that were processed into 100 by 100 pixels and converted them into 1D arrays.
										Evaluated the model's performance by calculating accuracy on the tests on average. As a result, it achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset demonstrating its effectiveness and accurately predicted the category of a new image as
										‘cat’ showing the model's practical use. The project displayed competence in machine learning and image classification in Python. Though the project
										was a simplified version it provided foundations for more complex vision tasks in future. </p>

									<h3>Bebras Challenge</h3>
									<p>Achieved a 143 in the Bebras Challenge designed for students with a passion for problem solving and computer science which consisted of a series of
										complex questions encompassing mathematics and logic, requiring continuous cognitive development and adaptability in problem solving strategies. Demonstrated my commitment to honing my problem solving skills in dynamic and challenging environments whilst also reflecting my aptitude for
										critical thinking. </p>

									<h3>Volunteered in Multiple Charities</h3>
									<p>Raised over £1000 and dedicated time volunteering with a charity focused on raising vital funds for the Moroccan floods and also on another occasion
										for the Turkey earthquakes. Actively stepped outside my comfort zone to educate, persuade and request donations from different people in the community. Developed strong interpersonal and communication skills. </p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Tuition in GCSE Maths</h3>
									<p>Provided guidance to a student who changed from foundation to higher mathematics in the last quarter of their final year which ultimately increased
										their grade from a 4 to a 6, this experience underscores my commitment to education, my ability to adapt to individual learning needs and my success in
										fostering tangible improvements in academic performance. </p>
